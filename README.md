## Installation

### This mod only functions if the server host has it installed (it's Server-Side and Vanilla-compatible)

Only the server host needs this mod.

You can install this mod and host a lobby, and it will work just fine **for everyone**.

However, if you join a lobby where the host does not have this mod, it will not work.

## Usage

Simply type `!scan` into the chat. You will get a reply telling you the amount of items and their values.

## Configuration

### Value approximation

You can configure the command to only show an approximation of the total value.

This is similar to the `scan` terminal command in vanilla.

### Compact response

This is for all the "complete sentence" people out there.

When you turn this off, the reply will be formatted as a complete, grammatically correct sentence.

It also makes it way harder to interpret the reply, so just keep it off.

### Auto-Announce loot

So you know how some players like to stay on the terminal during the landing, and then type two numbers in the chat?

This mod can do that automatically.

Also, for anyone wondering:
The first number is the amount of loot on the planet, and the second number is the amount of beehives.
